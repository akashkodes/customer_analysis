The dataset comprises sales data for various commodities across the United States, focusing only on two gender identities. As a result, the dashboard displays information solely for these two genders. However, it would be intriguing to explore sales among individuals with different gender identities. The dashboard aims to provide insights into sales based on gender, age, region, and discounts, offering valuable assistance to businesses in multiple ways. Some intial key references that can be drawn from the dashboard includes:

1) Assessing the impact of significant discounts on specific commodities: Analyzing whether offering substantial discounts on particular products, such as computers, leads to increased sales.

2) Tailoring marketing strategies based on target audiences: The dashboard allows for identifying regional differences in consumer spending habits. For instance, it may reveal that the 60-70 age group spends the most in the West region, while the 30-40 age group dominates spending in other regions. Such insights can inform targeted marketing approaches.

3) Leveraging gender-based sales analysis for marketing decisions: The data shows that females in Wisconsin spend 50% more on entertainment than males. Although the dataset only includes information for two genders, exploring sales across individuals with diverse gender identities would provide further valuable insights.

These are just a few examples of the diverse insights that businesses can utilize to improve efficiency and increase profits. (The datasource is provided by Stanley George Joseph)
